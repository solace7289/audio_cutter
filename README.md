audio cutter ~~ version stone age
_________________________________

Need to put (only one) origin mp3 file in folder 'input'.
Then run (by command: `node index.js`) -> input start, end time.

---------------------------------

You need to install ffmpeg in your computer and add in PATH to run.
And you need to delete origin mp3 file after each time use.

Have fun with 'Stone age audio cutter cli'!!
